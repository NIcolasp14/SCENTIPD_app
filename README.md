# SCENTIPD_app
The app I built for my team iGem Athens 2023 for the iGem competition. I was personally congratulated by the host of the iGem competition for my work. It is an app that takes an image, processes it via an advanced and error correcting image processing pipeline and uses machine learning to extract an early Parkinson's Disease diagnosis from colorimetric results. The trained model that extracts the diagnosis couldn't be loaded due to its size. It is an .h5 file.
